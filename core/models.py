Some parts of Pydici require being a member of a group with access to specific
features.

To check if a user has access to a feature from Python code, use
`utils.user_has_feature()` or the `decorator.pydici_feature()` decorator.

To check for access from a template, use `{% if pydici_feature.<feature_name> %}`.
