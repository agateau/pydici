# INSTALLATION

Pydici can be installed as any Django project. Just drop the code somewhere
and setup Apache.

To install all python prerequisites, just do that: pip install -r requirements.txt. It is strongly advised to use a virtual env.

## Detailed installation

Drop source code in a directory readable by your apache user
   git clone https://github.com/digitalfox/pydici.git

Create a virtual env in a directory readable by your apache user and activate it
   virtual-env pydici-venv
   . pydici-venv/bin/activate

Install prerequisites :
   pip install -r <path to pydici source code>/requirements.txt

Setup your favorite database (mysql/mariaDB or postgresql) and create a schema/base (with UTF-8 character set please) with a valid user that can create/alterselect/delete/update its objects.

Configure your database in pydici/settings.py. Look at django docs to understand the various database options.

Create tables with :

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py migrate

Generate a new secret key with ./manage.py generate_secret_key and put it in pydici/settings.py

Collect static files with ./manage.py collectstatic

Setup your apache virtual env:
- activate mod_wsgi.
- activate ssl
- active mod_expires
- add Alias to /media and /static
- define auth backend. By default, pydici is designed to work with an http front end authentication. Look at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/auth-remote-user/

## Updating an existing installation

After pulling the latest changes you need to update the database.

There are two possible situations, depending on whether your installation already uses South. Your installation uses South if there is a `south_migrationhistory` table in your database.

1. Your installation already uses South. Run these commands:

        ./manage.py syncdb
        ./manage.py migrate

2. Your installation does not use South yet. Run these commands:

        ./manage.py syncdb
        ./manage.py migrate --all 0001 --fake
        ./manage.py migrate

    Once this is done, future updates will be handled as situation #1.
